## Notes

I had a hard time setting up the collection view. Getting the collection view to look exactly how I wanted it was very difficult. Also having trouble with pushing code to Github as it always claims I'm trying to merge. I was in the midst of implementing a trailer video, a search bar, and more features but they weren't complete and were taking longer than expected.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Difficult to understand what exactly JSON does initially, but the more you use it, the more you understand the concept of implementing JSON into the app.
